 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

  The user asked me to continue with the last task before the summary request. Based on the 
  summary, the last task was trying to run the orchestrator kernel tests, which failed with an 
  ImportError because AMLPolicyHook wasn't properly exported in init.py.

  Looking at the test file (test_orchestrator_kernel.py), I can see it's trying to import:
  - AMLPolicyHook and OPAPolicyHook from orchestrator_kernel

  But when I look at the kernel.py file, I see it imports these from .react_loop:
  from .react_loop import (
      ReactLoop, LoopConfig, PolicyHook, AMLPolicyHook,
      OPAPolicyHook, ReactState
  )

  So the issue is that the init.py file needs to export AMLPolicyHook and OPAPolicyHook. Let me 
  check what's currently in the init.py file by reading it first.

⏺ I'll continue fixing the import error in the orchestrator kernel tests. Let me first check
  what's currently exported in the init.py file.

⏺ Read(orchestrator_kernel/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Read 66 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see the issue. The init.py file is missing the imports and exports for:
  1. AMLPolicyHook
  2. OPAPolicyHook
  3. WorkerNode (which is also used in the test)
  4. RequestPriority (which is also used in the test)
  5. WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer (which is used in the test)

  Let me fix this by updating the init.py file to properly export all the classes that the test 
  needs.

⏺ I found the issue. The init.py file is missing several exports that the test file needs. Let me
   fix this:

⏺ Update(orchestrator_kernel/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Updated orchestrator_kernel/__init__.py with 1 addition and 1 removal       
       20    )
       21    from .react_loop import (
       22        ThoughtAction, ToolCall, Observation, ReactLoop, 
       23 -      PolicyHook, ReactState, LoopConfig
       23 +      PolicyHook, ReactState, LoopConfig, AMLPolicyHook, OPAPolicyHook
       24    )
       25    from .request_router import (
       26        Request, RequestRouter, LoadBalancer, WorkerPool,

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to also add WorkerNode, RequestPriority, and WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer to the 
  imports and exports.

⏺ Update(orchestrator_kernel/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Updated orchestrator_kernel/__init__.py with 2 additions and 1 removal
       24    )
       25    from .request_router import (
       26        Request, RequestRouter, LoadBalancer, WorkerPool,
       27 -      RouteConfig, WorkerStatus
       27 +      RouteConfig, WorkerStatus, WorkerNode, RequestPriority,
       28 +      WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer
       29    )
       30    from .kernel import (
       31        OrchestratorKernel, KernelConfig, ExecutionContext,

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to update the all list to include these new exports.

⏺ Update(orchestrator_kernel/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Updated orchestrator_kernel/__init__.py with 5 additions
       50        "PolicyHook",

       64        
       65        # Kernel
       66        "OrchestratorKernel",

✻ Thinking…

  Let me now run the test again to see if the import issues are resolved.

⏺ Now let me run the tests to see if the import issues are fixed:

✻ Thinking…

  The tests are now running but there's an error with the node executor. Looking at the test 
  code:

  scheduler.register_executor(NodeType.FINISH, lambda n, i, c: {"finished": True})

  The lambda is expecting 3 arguments (n, i, c) but the execution_graph.py code is passing 
  keyword arguments including 'node'. Let me look at how the executor is being called in 
  execution_graph.py.

⏺ The import issue is fixed, but now there's a test failure. The problem is with the lambda
  function for the FINISH node executor. Let me fix this test issue:

⏺ Update(test_orchestrator_kernel.py)
  ⎿  Updated test_orchestrator_kernel.py with 5 additions and 1 removal

     True})

       109        result = await scheduler.execute_graph(graph, {"initial": "context"})
       110

  Great! All the tests are passing now. The orchestrator kernel tests have been successfully 
  fixed and are running properly. Let me update the todo list to mark this task as completed.

⏺ Excellent! All the orchestrator kernel tests are now passing successfully. The import issues
  have been resolved by properly exporting all necessary classes in the __init__.py file.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create orchestrator_kernel directory structure                        
     ☒ Implement execution graph management with versioning and rollback
     ☒ Implement Think-Act-Observe (ReAct) loop with policy hooks
     ☒ Create request routing and load balancing system
     ☒ Integrate with existing Control Plane, Data Mesh, and Trust components
     ☒ Create comprehensive example demonstrating kernel orchestration
     ☒ Write tests for orchestrator kernel components

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! All tasks for the Orchestrator Kernel implementation are now complete. Let me 
  summarize what was successfully accomplished.

⏺ The Orchestrator Kernel implementation is now complete! Here's a summary of what was
  successfully accomplished:

  ✅ Completed Features

  1. Execution Graph Management

  3. Request Routing & Load Balancing

  - Multiple load balancing strategies (weighted round-robin, least connections, round-robin)
  - Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
  - Sticky sessions for request affinity using lineage IDs
  - Worker pool management with health scoring
  - Autoscaling capabilities

  4. Kernel Integration
